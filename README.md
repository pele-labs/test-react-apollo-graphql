# Whitewater Test - React - Apollo GraphQL!


Hey there! We are Whitewater.
We build great products and we probably want you to join our team!

**Here you have a fun test assignment so:**
1. You can know better if you want to join us!
2. You can know better our tech stack.
3. We can know you better.
4. We can know better if you may fit our team.


How it works
-------------
1. The test will evolve over time and will be open-sourced. Each candidate improves the test by submitting pull requests.
2. The test should last not more than 5 hours. We don't want you to spend too much time on it and we don't want to spend too much time on its assessment either.
3. Submission of the test is just like a submission of a pull request. In addition to the code-review and the comments we will merge in great submissions.
4. With each merge, we will improve the test and make it more interesting.
5. Write as if you were writing a code for an open-source library. Comments, tests are more than welcomed

Our Stack
------
1. Nodejs
2. React
3. React Native
3. Graphql
4. MongoDB
5. Apollo
6. SCSS


The Task
-------
The current task is to build an on-boarding chat experience as a website. It should work on mobile as well as in desktops. A good example can be found at Lemonade, one of our favorite apps with a brilliant UX.

Here are a few examples:

You should structure the app the way you want.
We recommend on the following, but you need to choose:
1. Githunt-React from Apollo: https://github.com/apollographql/GitHunt-React
2. NextJS
3. React-Universally - https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-universally
You choose - but you need to be able to tell us why you chose what you chose.

The final product should include the start of conversation, with at least one question and one widget. You should decide on the complexity of the conversation engine. It can be simple and pre defined within the code or it can be more complex.



**Good luck!**
We are here for any question (Just open an issue).
